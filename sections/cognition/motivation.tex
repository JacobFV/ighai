When we are prevented from realizing our objectives, we naturally feel frustrated. However the degree to which such fraustration manifests is largerly dependent on our expectations. If we expect to achieve our objectives quickly and easily, then we will be more frustrated when we are prevented from doing so. If we expect to achieve our objectives slowly and with difficulty, then we will be less frustrated when we are prevented from doing so. Thus, the more patient we are, the less frustrated we will be.
