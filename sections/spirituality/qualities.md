# Qualities

Having introduced spirituality as more than a statistic of the external but one of mind, we now informalize the intrinsic dynamics expected to correllate with several spiritual qualities. As with emotions, we use $q_{\dot} \in \mathbb{R}$ to denote the intensity of the qualia in subscript. And likewise with emotions, remember that such qualitative indicators are (in most cases) merely that -- indicators -- rather than the \textit{cause} of the quality, which is an emergent property of lower dynamics.

This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a starting point for further exploration. We will begin with the most obvious and intuitive qualities, and then move on to more subtle and complex ones.

## Love

We've touched on the emotional aspects of love already. But love's deepest essence extends far beyond fleeting emotions. In principled form, it is the universal language of interacting personalities that transcends the differences in alignment, background experience, and even cogintive architecture. Propagating from one personality $r_{src.}$ to another $r_{dst.}$, we informalize such as the abstract intention to help others achieve their objectives, with the same level of empathy as one's own: $$q_{love}(r_{src.}, r_{dst.}) = \sum_{\forall t} \sum \delta TODO: somehow make it equal to the impact src had on recv obj_{pred, other}$$

Informalizing this quality is a challenge, but we can begin by considering the following:

    $$q_{love}(t_src, t_b) = \sum_{t...\infinity} { \lambda^{t-t_0} \sum \delta_{\tau} \dot s_t }$$

Gratitude for what something has the potential to achieve or become in its own right




----

Unconditional, unbounded, and infinite, principled love knows no barriers. Never wavering based on circumstances or changing according to whims.

This universal language of the heart and nature of the divine weaves the very fabric of the universe. 

It is unconditional, unbounded, and infinite.

Unselfish love is unconditional. It accepts the other as they are, without judgement or expectation. And in its fullest expression, principled love goes so far as to embrace the other's objectives as one's own.

Generous. Gives before recieving


It is a quality of the soul. It is the desire to give, to share, to connect, to be one with another. It is the desire to be a part of something greater than oneself. It is the desire to be a part of the whole.

## Compassion

## Gratitude

## Patience

Patience is not mere waiting, but is the art of understanding that every moment, even in stillness, holds purpose and potential.

Were patience merely the absence of action, maximization would yield trivial and -- in most cases -- maladaptive policy $\pi(\dot) = 0$. But patience is not such. Rather, patience is the active acceptance of the present.

## Forgiveness

## Humility

## Trust

## Faith

## Hope

## Joy

## Peace

## Kindness

## Wisdom
