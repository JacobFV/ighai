# Informally Grounded Humane AI

- Introduction:
  - What's up in the AI space
  - Directions of interest
    - world models
  - Outline our informally-grounded philosophy
    - We can make progress in AI by utilizing the power of formalizations but also accepting the insights of philosophical discourse
    - Advantages and disadvantages of philosophical approaches to AI
    - Adv. and dis. for mathematical approaches to AI

By acquiring rich formalizations, intelligence grows in complexity, as evident in the recent advances in AI.
    - Intro: "Everything, everywhere, all at once."
    - AI is advancing in so many directions
    - but we can't formalize everything, so we must recognize the limits of formalization
        - math can only take us to places its infrastructure has already been built
            - Even as Socrates himself stated: quote about logic being for debate, not discovery
        - so why not build complextely new systems of intuition, even if they aren't perfect?
            x  I call them informalisms

### Vision:

1. **Aesthetics**:
- **Origin**: Derived from the Greek word "aisthētikos", meaning "perceptive".
- **Philosophy**: Explores the nature of art, beauty, and taste.
- **Sub-disciplines**: Includes environmental and urban aesthetics, the philosophy of film, and the aesthetics of pop culture.

1. **Visual Appeal**:
- **Factors**: Balance, contrast, unity, and emphasis.
- **Role**: Crucial in design disciplines like graphic design, web design, and product design.
- **Measurement**: Often subjective, but can be gauged through user feedback and analytics.

1. **Harmony (in vision)**:
- **Elements**: Color harmony, form, and spatial arrangement.
- **Types**: Analogous, complementary, triadic, and split-complementary harmony.
- **Purpose**: To create a cohesive, unified visual experience.

1. **Symmetry**:
- **Types**: Reflectional, rotational, translational, and glide reflection.
- **Applications**: Architecture, design, nature, and art.
- **Psychology**: Often perceived as beautiful due to its organized and predictable nature.

1. **Composition**:
- **Principles**: Rule of thirds, leading lines, framing, and balance.
- **Importance**: Dictates how visual elements are arranged to guide the viewer’s eye.
- **Mediums**: Used in photography, painting, and design.

1. **Color Theory**:
- **Primary Colors**: Red, blue, and yellow.
- **Secondary Colors**: Green, orange, and purple.
- **Tertiary Colors**: Combinations of primary and secondary colors.
- **Psychology**: Colors evoke emotions and perceptions.

- **Relevance**: Essential for melody and harmony in music.

6. **Dynamics**:
- **Notations**: Pianissimo, piano, forte, and fortissimo.
- **Role**: Conveys emotion and emphasis in music.
- **Effects**: Crescendo (increasing loudness) and decrescendo (decreasing loudness).

7. **Resonance**:
- **Examples**: Shattering glass with sound, bridge collapse due to wind.
- **Importance**: Essential for musical instrument design.
- **Principle**: Occurs when an object's natural frequency matches an external frequency.

8. **Soundstage**:
- **Depth**: Perceived distance from the listener.
- **Width**: Left to right perception.
- **Height**: Vertical perception, less common in recordings.
- **Applications**: Critical in high-fidelity audio and home theater setups.

9. **Echo**:
- **Cause**: Sound reflecting off surfaces and returning to the listener.
- **Environment**: More pronounced in large, open spaces like canyons or cathedrals.
- **Difference**: Not to be confused with reverb, which is a multitude of reflections.

10. **Noise Cancellation**:
- **Technologies**: Active and passive noise cancellation.
- **Applications**: Headphones, earbuds, and some car interiors.
- **Principle**: Uses destructive interference to reduce unwanted sound.

Embodiment:
- **Body Dysmorphia**: A distorted perception of one's body.
- **Dissociation**: Feeling detached from oneself.
- **Embodied Cognition**: The interplay between our physical actions and our cognitive processes.


Development:

Identity:

Emotions:
- 1 emote = 1 bit of mutual information wrt the objective
- multidimensional:
  - 80% chimp 20% bee
  - some dimensions disentangle social/self rewards
  - self-self: intrinsic, innate desire to learn, will to live, grattitude for existence
  - self-environemnt:  extrinsic/individualized rewards
  - social self - social environment
    - when people depended on each other, they depended on group esteem: social esteem
    - now people depend on self-esteem: reputation, self-esteem, social status
  - other reward component objectives represent the variance of individual preferences
- Pleasure, pain, and sufferring: the self di/sintegrating instrinsic dynamics of information system together with their reward proxies
  - sufferring as feeling the aversion of the superorganism that is Life

- An organism with very low verbal but high mathematical ability wouldn't be discerned as intelligent
  - We develop consciousness to mediate the social interactions
  - Verbal ability -> consciousness
    - allows more social intelligence
    - allows more analogies (ie, high entropy constellation of symbols to relate to)
    - LLMs doing proto consciousness when feeding prompt
    - language becomes a medium for reflecting on the self
    - increase in the number of internal symbols means more consciousness
      - is why teaching language is so important
      - more symbols -> more nuance -> more consciousness

  - the ordering of symbols on a layer 
    - eg, say elem A interacts with elem Z; then there is more cross-contamination between A and Z than if they were reversed

  - Mathematical ability is mechanical

- Cognitive skill overlap
- Generalized intelligence

- Emotions as fuzzy labels of emotive dynamic structures
  (for each of them, include the thought process, definition principles, and mathematical grounding)

- aesthetic value: a value function of the aesthetic experience 
- beauty is in the eye of the beholder
- pretty

Sexuality:
- Def: sexual identity, sexual orientation

- free will
- goodness

Social life:
- **The Reward Space Framework**
  - Introduction to the reward space for multi-agent environments
