Trannsinformalizing Humanity

1. Introduction
2. Why transinformalize?
   1. Introduce the formal-informal divide
      1. Explain the formal world
      2. Explain the informal world
      3. Compare and contrast
      4. Show why both are necessary
   2. Problem: bridging the gulf
      1. Consider this problem in the abstract
         1. No real world phenomena can be formalized without loss of information.
         2. No formalization can be translated precisely into the real world.
         3. The qualitative dynamics of some phenomena cannot even be captured by formalisms.
         4. Formal systems are effective at taking us far, but only once their 'rails' have already been set in place by their underlying axioms.
         5. Informal approaches are effective at exploring new domains, but should ideally crystallize into formalisms once the domain is understood.
         6. The informal, while powerful in conveying meaning, can sometimes be too vague or subjective to offer concrete solutions to specific problems.
      2. Consider ways to increase their overlap
   3. Why AI needs to bridge the gulf:
      1. we can only optimize what we can formalize.
         1. whether we use heuristics to approximate the environment or control the environment to match our formalization, we must formalize
      2. If we continue treating AI as a formal system, we are bound to run into the same problems that formal systems have always run into.
      3. Any utility we derive from AI will be limited by the extent to which we can formalize its objective into the real world, or conversely, the extent to which we can 'transinformalize' the real world into its objective.
   4. By 'transinformalization' we mean a lose, whimsical system of heuristics barely lifting natural language into formal constructs, yet recognizing that it is not terribly precise or rigorous.
      1. The main idea is to soften the formalizations we use, and then create a lot of them that are used liberally to create a sort of "informalization" of the real world. or conversely, to "transinformalize" the real world into the weak formal statements.
         1. Instead of just one objective/eval/metric/etc, Transinformalization considers dozens of related heuristics under words with related meanings
      2. Recognizing that all measured signals eventually carry some degree of uncertainty, and most models likewise fail to capture all of the relevant information, we feel justified in taking this approach.
      3. The following sections will explore this idea in detail, using examples spanning the spectrum of human experience.
         1. Not to be taken as exhaustive, but to inspire the reader to think of their own examples, and provide seeds for autonomous generation of further informalisms. (\ref{sec:autonomous_transinformalization})
3. Existance
   1. Let's begin with the self-evident: we exist $\mathtt{exists}(a_{self})$
      1. We offer several definitions for this:
         1. Def 1:
      2. "we" referring to the individual $a_{self}$ as the integrated composition of all observation, thought, and action that can influence its behavior.
      3. With a healthy brain, this is practically makes us the sum of everything we've ever seen, heard, tasted, smelled, touched, thought, or done on our thread of existance.
      4. Formally, a given agent is identified by a_i = s_{i,1} s_{i,2} \ddots s_{i,t}
      5. This trajectory identifies us as a unique individual
         1. It lays the foundation for that which we can perceive, and the lens through which we perceive it.
      6. Definition: an individual is a 




   1. Let's begin by considering a multi-agent world formally given by $r = (r, o, A, f_{fw}, f_\psi, mathbb{R}, mathbb{O}, \mathcal{A})$ where
      $r \in \mathcal{R}$ is the true state of the world,
      $o \in \mathcal{O} \subset \mathbb{R}$ is the observed state of the world,
      $A \in \mathcal{A}$ is the set of agents,
      $f_{fw} : \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$ is the forward evolution operator,
      $f_\psi : \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}$ is the measurement (observation) operator,
      and $\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{O}, \mathcal{A}$ are the state space, observable state space, and agent space respectively.
   2. Informally, we have [describe it in simple terms]
      1. (Now let's go throught each of these in detail:)
      2. $r$ includes everything that is at the present
         1. Nothing exists outside of $r$. If it did, it would be part of $r$.
            1. $r, o, A, f_{fw}, f_\psi, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{O}, \mathcal{A}$ are all part of $r$.
            2. This means $r$ is at the same time both a formal and real object.
      3. $o_i$ includes all observation events that are relevant to $i$ at the moment
      4. [continue explaining]
      
      5. The forward function $f_{fw}$ is the function that maps the state space $\mathcal{R}$ to the observable state space $\mathcal{O}$.
      6. The observable state space $\mathcal{O}$ is the subset of the state space $\mathcal{R}$ that is accessible to the agents $\mathcal{A}$.
      7. The agents $\mathcal{A}$ are the set of agents that exist in the world $\mathcal{R}$.
4. Existance
   1. Let's begin with the self-evident: we exist $\mathtt{exists}(a_{self})$
      1. We are the sum totality of everything we've ever seen, touched, heard, smelled, tasted, thought, or done. Such define us as an individual:
      2. Definition: an individual is a 



      2. Or rather, we perceive that we exist $\mathtt{exists}_\mu(a_{self})$; we exist inside our own informal model of the world $\mu$; we exist *subjectively*.
      3. Definition: the **subjective** $S = s_1 s_2 \ddots s_t$ is the uniquely inner trajectory from which we experience existance.
         1. It lays the foundation for that which we can perceive, and the lens through which we perceive it.
      4. It should be undisputable to any reader that they do. Thus, we will take this tautology as the base-case to the following implication:
   2. Contrast this with the *objective* reality $\mathcal{R}_O$, which is only measured as a shared construct arising from the mutual recognition of individual observers $\mathcal{A}_{others}$ (who, from the perspective of $a_{self}$ are also part of $\mathcal{R}_O$)
      1. The nature of the objective is such that measurements taken from it remain consistent with prior measurements
      2. Thus, from any particular reference frame $f_i$, the objective reality $\mathcal{R}_O$ is a consistent, shared construct that can be measured and predicted.
      3. For instance, while our subjective experience tells us that we exist,


      6. While our cognitive states themselves may be objectively measured, our experience of their oerception is inherently subjective.


      5.  is the trajectory our inner world model experiences and predicts that constitute the experience of an individual.
    is the subset of information that is accessable to the
         1. It can vary significantly from one individual to another, making it inherently unique and personal.

   2. Our understanding and interpretation of the world is constantly shaped by this interplay between the subjective and the objective. While we can never truly escape our subjective lens (since all perception and understanding is inherently processed through our personal experiences and cognitive structures), we can aim to approach a more objective understanding through methods such as scientific investigation, logical reasoning, and empirical observation.
      1. For example, science aims to provide objective explanations for phenomena by relying on empirical evidence and systematic observation, rather than personal beliefs or interpretations.

   3. It is essential to acknowledge the distinction between subjective and objective realities to navigate the world effectively. By recognizing the limitations and biases of our subjective experiences, we can strive for a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the world around us.
