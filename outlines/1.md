      1. Want (implicit sense) to maximize reward manifest in behavior
4. Cognition
       1. Example: the multiagent reward vector framework
          1. Establish notation and system
          2. Alignment







1. Explain the two worlds: the formal and the informal
    1. explain the formal domain, characteristics, data structures, algorithms, etc.
        > Formalisms, born out of the meticulous rigor of mathematics and logic, seek to structure, define, and predict. They are the shadows we cast onto the canvas of understanding, hoping to capture the essence of reality. Yet, by nature, models are only abstractions of and not the essence of nature itself. Physics, for instance, employs models to approximate systems, often resulting in inevitable deviations between prediction and observation.
    2. explain the informal approach:
        > The informal approach, on the other hand, relies on intuition, heuristics, and qualitative understanding. It is the domain of philosophers, artists, and storytellers. Through narratives, metaphors, and analogies, they capture the essence of the universe and the human experience in it. While they may lack the precision of formal models, they often offer a broader, more holistic view of existence. They appeal to our senses and emotions, making the vast complexities of the universe more relatable and comprehensible.
    1. Explain why and how people 
    2. Problem:
        1. Fundamentally stems from a mismatch in the strength/rigor/precision of information dynamics between the two worlds.
           1. Formal is exact
           2. Informal is fuzzy
            > The informal, while powerful in conveying meaning, can sometimes be too vague or subjective to offer concrete solutions to specific problems.
        2. No real world phenomena can be formalized without loss of information.
        3. Not all phenomena lend themselves to strict formalism.
        4. Formal systems are effective at taking us far, but only once their 'rails' have already been set in place by their underlying axioms.
        5. Informal approaches are effective at exploring new domains, but should ideally crystallize into formalisms once the domain is understood.
        6. Neither is sufficient on its own.
            Sadly, as we delve deeper into the intricacies of existence, we inevitably find both — be they equations or narratives — failing to explain or predict our observations. The universe, in its infinite complexity, presents challenges not surmounted by one alone.
    3. The broader background of this dualality
        1. share philosophical comment on this gulf
        2. while the overlap continues to grow, the gulf remains
              1. the universe relevant to intelligent must possess order and organization or else intelligence would be useful.
    4. But unlike those cases, the Problem cannot be ignored for AI:
        1. No AI problem domain is isolated from the complexity and nuance of the real world.
        2. whether we use heuristics to approximate the environment or control the environment to match our formalization, we must formalize
        3. we can only optimize what we can formalize.
        4. The more we're able to formalize, the more complex and capable our systems become.
     5. Provide a theoretical/philosophical basis for why to consider merging both approaches in AI
        > These two approaches, while seemingly at odds, are in fact complementary. The formal provides the structure and precision necessary for prediction and technology advancement, while the informal gives meaning, context, and a sense of wonder to our existence. Together, they offer a more complete understanding of the universe.

    5. We want to share a novel paradigm that we think will be effective for accelerating and automating the process by which we grow our formal domain: we call it "Transinformalization"
2. Main Idea: Transinformalization
   1. The main idea is to soften the formalizations we use, and then create a lot of them that are used liberally to create a sort of "soft formalization" of the real world.
      1. and recognizing that all measured signals carry some degree of uncertainty, and most models likewise fail to capture all of the relevant information, we feel justified in taking this approach.
      2. Instead of just one objective/eval/metric/etc, Informalization considers dozens of related heuristics under words with related meanings
   2. Transiformalisms are large fuzzy formal systems that allow for many different formalizations of the same phenomena.
      1. This observation could be many different kinds: a visual observation, a quantum measurement, a natural language utterance heard, being aware of the universe's existance, etc.
      2. This observation process $O = \langle o_1, o_2, ..., o_n \rangle$ is a sequence of observations coding for the phenomena $p$ being observed.
