\#\# Intelligence learns by doing

Our form of intelligence takes a very 'action first, perception second' approach to learning. This is in contrast to the 'perception first, action second' approach of most machine learning algorithms.

\definition{Learning}{The process of acquiring new information or behaviors}

\#\# Intelligence generalizes

- relating old information to new information

\#\# Intelligence adapts

\definte{Adaptation}{Learning for the sake of function}
\definte{Adaptability}{the ability to adapt}

\#\# Open-endedness
