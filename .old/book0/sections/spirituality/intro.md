Spritiuality begins with a belief in something greater than the mundane, and the belief that this something is worth pursuing. For our purposes, let this something be the thought that has the most power over the agent: $$\tau_{god} = \max_{\tau \in \Tau} \sum_{t...\infinity} { \lambda^{t-t_0} \sum \delta_{\tau} \dot s_t }$$ remembering that $T$ is the set of all thoughts, $s_t$ is the state of the agent at time $t$, $\sum \delta_{\tau} \dot s_t$ is the influence of the thought $\Tau$ on the agent's state, and $\sum_{t...\infinity} { \lambda^{t-t_0} \sum \delta_{\tau} \dot s_t }$ is the discounted sum influence of that thought on the agent's state over the course of the agent's life, perhaps with normalization or learned infuence projection. Note that influence is measured over the agent's state, not actions. This is more congruent with the thought of spirituality as a deeply personal experience, emphasizing feelings and beliefs that might not be universally shared or easily quantified, unlike rituals or association with like-minded agents -- thought such external factors may certainly be significant to an agent's own spirituality if they occupy significant territory in the state space. Measuring internal rather than external influence also allows us to sidestep the question of whether the agent's beliefs are correct or not, and focus on the agent's own experience of spirituality. Finally, making a god out of the maximal thought allows it to inherit the rich dynamics of all thoughts, including the ability to exert influence over other thoughts, to direct reward flow, the ability to change over time, integrate with a learned belief system of beleif thoughts, and so on.

The belief network $\Tau$ is a losely defined subgraph of thoughts in the thought set that have significant attachement to $\tau_{god}$.
