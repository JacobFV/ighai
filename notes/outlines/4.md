3. 

4. Introduce the formal-informal divide
   1. Explain the formal world
   2. Explain the informal world
   3. Compare and contrast
   4. Show why both are necessary
5. Problem: bridging the gulf
   1. Consider this problem in the abstract
      1. No real world phenomena can be formalized without loss of information.
      2. No formalization can be translated precisely into the real world.
      3. The qualitative dynamics of some phenomena cannot even be captured by formalisms.
      4. Formal systems are effective at taking us far, but only once their 'rails' have already been set in place by their underlying axioms.
      5. Informal approaches are effective at exploring new domains, but should ideally crystallize into formalisms once the domain is understood.
      6. The informal, while powerful in conveying meaning, can sometimes be too vague or subjective to offer concrete solutions to specific problems.
   2. Consider ways to increase their overlap
6. Why AI needs to bridge the gulf:
   1. we can only optimize what we can formalize.
      1. whether we use heuristics to approximate the environment or control the environment to match our formalization, we must formalize
   2. If we continue treating AI as a formal system, we are bound to run into the same problems that formal systems have always run into.
   3. Any utility we derive from AI will be limited by the extent to which we can formalize its objective into the real world, or conversely, the extent to which we can 'transinformalize' the real world into its objective.
7. By 'transinformalization' we mean a lose, whimsical system of heuristics barely lifting natural language into formal constructs, yet recognizing that it is not terribly precise or rigorous.
   1. Explain the etymology of the word
   2. The main idea is to soften the formalizations we use, and then create a lot of them that are used liberally to create a sort of "informalization" of the real world. or conversely, to "transinformalize" the real world into the weak formal statements.
      1. Instead of just one objective/eval/metric/etc, Transinformalization considers dozens of related heuristics under words with related meanings
   3. Recognizing that all measured signals eventually carry some degree of uncertainty, and most models likewise fail to capture all of the relevant information, we feel justified in taking this approach.
   4. The following sections will explore this idea in detail, using examples spanning the spectrum of human experience.
      1. Not to be taken as exhaustive, but to inspire the reader to think of their own examples, and provide seeds for autonomous generation of further informalisms. (\ref{sec:autonomous_transinformalization})
